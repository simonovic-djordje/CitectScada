# Project Documentation: Motor Lubricant Production and Packaging

## Production of Packaging

This system describes the operation of a facility for the production of motor lubricants and their packaging in pre-manufactured containers. The process begins with the production of packaging in which the lubricant will ultimately be packed. To manufacture the packaging, specific ingredients, color pigment, additives, and polypropylene are mixed in a mixer. Color pigment and additives are taken from reservoirs as they are in liquid form. When the reservoirs are emptied, and the mixer is filled with additives and color pigment, constant replenishment of the reservoirs with pigment and additives is maintained through pumps. While filling the mixer with additives and color pigment, polyurethane is also added. Afterward, the mixer is lowered, and mixing and merging into a homogeneous mixture begin. Following this, a certain amount of the mixture is released through an electric valve into a pipe surrounded by heaters. The heaters heat the mixture to a specific temperature, after which a piston is activated, pushing the mixture into a mold. In the mold, fans cool and release the shaped bottle onto a conveyor belt. The bottles are then conveyed to a section of the facility for the production and filling of lubricants.

## Production of Motor Lubricants

The process involves various additives and base oil, which are placed in the main mixer in a specific proportion, forming a homogeneous mixture. At the beginning of the process, all reservoirs are filled to the allowed limit. Later, when they are emptied, the same pumps are used to replenish them to the allowed limit. Three types of additives—dispersant, detergent, and anticorrosive—are individually released into the main additive mixer via an electric valve after filling their respective reservoirs. Aditives are not used in the same quantities; each is released in a specified amount into the additive mixer. Simultaneously, a certain quantity of base oil is released into the main mixer through an electric valve. After everything in the additive mixer is mixed, and the additives are combined, the mixture is passed to the main mixer with base oil. In the main mixer, everything is combined to achieve a homogeneous mixture. After that, bottles, previously manufactured and conveyed by a moving belt, are filled via the filling station.
